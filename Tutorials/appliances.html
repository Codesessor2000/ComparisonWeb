                        the
                        size or capacity of the refrigerator. It is important to have a fair idea of the space where you
                        plan to put the refrigerator. At the time of buying a fridge online, you must figure out that it
                        would easily fit a small-sized room or it should be large in size and capacity to fit the needs
                        of a
                        large family. Keeping in mind your requirements, you can check out the vast array of single door
                        refrigerators, double door refrigerators, triple door refrigerators, side-by-side refrigerators,
                        and
                        French door refrigerators on Gadgets Now at affordable prices.
                        <br>
                        Usually, a fridge with less than 200-litre capacity is sufficient for 1-2 members. A fridge with
                        a
                        capacity of 200-350 litre can be a good option for families with 3-4 members. And, for large
                        families, a refrigerator of size 400 litre and above can be looked up to.
                        <br>
                        So look out for refrigerators of different capacities and choose the one that suits the family
                        size
                        & household requirements.

                        year. And, these appliances are rated between one to five stars, the higher the rating, the
